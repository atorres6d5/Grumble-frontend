# Grumble-frontend
>Group project to create a snack review app.

## Who is this for?
----
Every day Galvanize students rush to the kitchen to grab their favorite snack. Students only take one to make sure there are plenty to share. It is hard to try a new snack when looking at the selection because you don't want to make a wrong choice. Grumble is a way to rate all the snacks in the kitchen and even leave reviews about them. users can change and delete their reviews, and save all reviews to their own porfile.
